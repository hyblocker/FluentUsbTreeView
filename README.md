# Fluent USB Tree View

This is a project which aims to modernise USB View from the Windows SDK samples. It rewrites the entire application in C# to take advantage of a heavily skinned WPF frontend to use modern UI practices, giving the illusion of WinUI3 without the bloat that's associated with it.
